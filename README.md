I have developed a FIFA Ultimate Team application for both Android and iOS, utilizing React Native and Expo. The data is sourced from the free tier of the FUTDB API, which may result in slightly slower loading times for images. The application is still under development as I continue to enhance and refine my React Native skills. Feedback and contributions are welcome. Thank you for checking out my project!
